			<h4>D.E.S.U - Delhi Electronica Supply Unit [Euphoric Magazine]</h4>
			<p>"A shunt capacitator for commercial music and a feeder box for new wave electronica are transmitting from New Delhi, 
			wired musicians and electro freaks have activated Delhi Electronica Supply Unit!" — The introduction to the D.E.S.U. facebook group.<p>
			<p>D.E.S.U is Delhi's homegrown music police: a collective effort to create a unique experience and keep the underground vibe 
			ignited and alive. The cream of the capital city's talented artist force has joined hands with a mission to propagate local 
			electronica from the capital city. D.E.S.U is not limited to a single genre or a music style. In fact, the unit includes Djs 
			as well as visual artists, "alternating currents changing direction with a regular frequency of experimental, high wattage electro 
			harmonic and live performances." D.E.S.U promises to deliver a unique sound experience, through LIVE electronica.
<p>
			<p>D.E.S.U, which came into existence in the June of 2008 has been provided inputs by Brin Desai, Chintan Kalra, Samrat, 
			Bagula Bhagat, Manu, Poonam and Bardo State, each of whom had a definite role to play. Held mostly in Café Morrison, 
			monthly events had been a huge success until the club got shut down for renovation recently. 
			The unit is up and running since Feb this year again.<p>
			<p>Ravana is an electronic artist based in Delhi. He also produces under the pseudonym 'Lankesh’.
			Originally a huge fan of heavy metal, Ravana was introduced to Drum and Bass which made a huge impact on his music. 
			Also a passionate poet, Ravana has been involved in the Delhi DnB scene for quite some time now. entered the electronica 
			scene in early 2000 with a band Called Dbasc (D: Z, lsh, & Ravana). We were a D] Quartet playing Drum N Bass in Delhi” he says. 
			Dbasc could possibly be one of the earliest BASS collective in India. "I was Taru's (Delhi sultanate, who is a popular EMCEE) first 
			D] when he played at D.E.S.U. I'm D.E.S.U's in house Drum & Bass guy and I Kick at the Venue”, Ravana says with a quirky tone.<p>
			<p>Ravana exclusively plays Drum & Bass for the Various D.E.S.U gigs in the city. He is joined by various bands such as Nucleya, Da Saz, Hari & Sukhmani, FUI\‘Cinturnali0na] and Khirkee Gharana. Various genres including Dubstep, Techno and Unique music from around the globe are played. and Live acts are joined by visual artists who add the extra dimension to the gigs in their own form.
			<p>
			<p>Shivnakaun is Vinny Bhagat, a visual artist who studied Music Technology in the University of Adelaide. 
			Vinny also performs as Sin;dr0me, a collaborative project with He has done two concerts for D,E.S.U. A sonic researcher himself, 
			the concert in early 2009 saw an Audio Visual performance. In February early this year, Vinny contributed with a visual performance 
			for the whole lineup. Vinny clearly conceptualizes his ideas about the Unit. That for me is to maintain a lineup that attracts people 
			who write & perform original music. I'm not happy with DJs playing a set list". "The second aspect is to make it as Live as possible, 
			not playback from iTunes etc."<p>
			<p>Samrat (Audio Pervert) is one of the Key contributors to the underground music movement in Delhi. Teddyb0yKill is a 
			live performance electronica band consisting of Samrat, Toymob (Ashhar) and Tahska(Akshat’s name in reverse). 
			With a zillion gigs to their credit, Teddy Boy Kill have had their share of contribution to D.E.S.U. While Samrat was in the 
			main organizing and the D.E.S.U design team, TBK played the first D.E.S.U and the first reunion gigs. Samrat talks 
			about the different kinds of people in the electronic scene in lndia at the moment. He says, "Dubstep is a trend. 
			Half the people on it are trendy people who used to like Trance and House at one point. I see it like that. Simple."<p>
			<p>D.E.S.U aims at introducing newer forms of electronica to the audience. "Generating collective vibrations of ideas, 
			music, artworks & Computers, DESU sets will feature alternating currents changing direction with a regular frequency of 
			experimental, high wattage electro harmonic and live performances/' With their gigs happening successfully and agenda clearly set, 
			D.E.S.U is promoting indigenous talent and creating an independent space for musicians in the country.<p>

			<h4>What's there to sing about? [Retrospective]</h4>
			<p>The evolution of music over the past few decades has seen vast contrasts in what independent musicians are singing about. 
			Although singing about love and romance is still commonplace, the Indian music scene is witnessing a lot of  young musicians exploring  
			subjects as diverse as esoterism and political issues to weave more exquisite compositions that dwell into deeper subject matter.
			</p>
			<p>Indian classical music, specially down south in the Carnatic region  saw evolution strictly inspired by the 'Bhakti movement', 
			with saints like Tyagaraja and many such, singing about the gods and romancing their personified egos. Although improvisation does 
			exist in Carnatic music, it has taken a backseat in the commercial scene. Hindustani music in the north was, however, influenced greatly 
			by Persian culture and hence, Islamic/Sufi ideologies. Hindustani music is mostly freestyle and impromptu now, but religion is 
			nevertheless freely interspersed with compositions a lot of times. Ditto with Indian art from the rural folk, which provides us 
			ample examples of this phenomenon in Tanjore Paintings and Madhubani paintings that depict the Gods and Goddesses in their full 
			glory. One can notice even today in classical concerts, sweeter, melodic Ragas being sung more often than their  shadier, darker 
			counterparts. Post Independence lyrical geniuses such as Bharathiyar and Rabindranath Tagore contributed heavily to the scene soon 
			afterwards, steering the newly formed Indian democracy towards Art and a more cultured thought. </p>
			<p>Fast forward a couple of decades with the rise of Internet and Youtube, the mushrooming of websites providing easy access to 
			knowledge coupled with substance use/abuse, which has played a very important role in the way people perceive the music in a world 
			blinded by the pop subtleties of Bollywood Romance and artificial living. India is witnessing a phenomenon where musicians are not 
			afraid to venture into territories other than themes tagged with 'love', 'romance', 'mist', 'autumn' et cetera. Genres such as Drone, 
			Noise, Witch-house and ofcourse, a lot of underground artists from Germany and Japan and Russia whose music is meditative, organic and 
			peculiar, are being embraced by listeners and artists searching for unique sound, something that matches with their individual 
			personalities. Ethnic pagan music from Africa, Scandinavia and the rest of the world needs special mention as it is still very fresh 
			and in fact, consumed in the mainstream Indian market even without the branding. Some sub-genres of Metal music is essentially Pagan, 
			with references to the Northern gods and their worship. Abstract musical imagery is one theme of prime focus that incorporates random 
			elements in the form of field recordings to provide emotion rather than straight-forward lyrics.</p>
			<p>In the other end of the musical spectrum is Political activism, total attachment to the civilization. Speeches by our beloved Netas 
			are being layered with snaring beats and bass to create funky and meaningful music that is amplifying the struggle against corruption, 
			global warming and the system in general.  Although the concept is not exactly new, the way it is being executed by artists such as 
			'Ravana' and 'Mumbai Mafia', is very bold and different. 'Delhi Sultanate' rooted in the Sound System Culture would be a perfect example, 
			with his Extra bold and sans-lenience style of addressing issues. </p>
			<p>The current generation of young musicians is more intelligent than ever. Innovative music making is being fueled by rapid growth 
			in Technology. In an era where a single click of a mouse can create complicated rhythms and melodies, the only difference between 
			good and exceptional art is the Subject. Although musicianship hardly provides monetary benefit, India is witnessing a proliferation 
			of independent and original thinkers who will hopefully craft for India, an original, authentic and an 'intellectual' sound.  </p>
